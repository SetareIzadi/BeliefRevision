# Belief Revision Agent

This is a simple Python program that implements a belief revision agent based on the AGM postulates (Success, Inclusion, Vacuity, Consistency, Extensionality).

- No imports used
- Beliefs are revised to stay logically consistent
- Uses basic CNF conversion and resolution to check entailment

## How to use

Run the file in Python to test the belief revision agent and see how it handles different belief updates.

## Example

Initial beliefs:
- "p"
- "p -> q"

Revising with "q" adds it and keeps the belief base consistent.
